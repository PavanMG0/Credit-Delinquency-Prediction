# Credit-Delinquency-Prediction
## 💡 Objective
Analyze credit‐account data to uncover delinquency patterns and risk factors, enabling proactive risk mitigation, customer segmentation, and targeted financial strategies.

___

## 📂 Dataset Overview
- Total Accounts: 500
- Delinquent Accounts: 80 (16% overall delinquency rate)
- Average Credit Utilization: 50%
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio: 30%
- Average Credit Score: 577.72 (min: 301, max: 847)

___

## 🛠️ Analytical Workflow
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values, ensuring no null entries in key metrics
- Standardized categorical labels for employment status and age groups
- Verified numeric ranges for utilization, DTI, loan balances, and credit scores
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plotted delinquency counts by employment status and age group
- Charted delinquency rates across locations (LA, Houston, Phoenix, Chicago, New York)
- Examined credit utilization and debt-to-income distributions by segment
- Analyzed average missed-payment rates by employment status
### 3. Risk Driver Identification
- Found high delinquency volumes among Employed Adults
- Observed highest missed-payment rates in Self-Employed and Employed individuals
- Identified Los Angeles and Houston as geographic hot spots
- Measured how rising DTI and credit utilization correlate with defaults
### 4. Customer Segmentation
- Defined high-risk segment: Employed in the Old age group(Have more Delinquent accounts and high Loan Balance)
- Segmented Unemployed and Self-Employed customers for tailored outreach
- Flagged low-risk Segments (Retirees, low-DTI Adults) for upsell opportunities

___

## 📈 Key Insights

- Employed and Self-Employed customers miss payments most frequently
- Gold cardholders hold the highest loan balances (6 M), though not necessarily the worst delinquency rates
- Los Angeles (19.6%) and Houston (16.8%) show significantly higher delinquency rates
- Accounts exceeding 70% utilization present early warning signals

___
